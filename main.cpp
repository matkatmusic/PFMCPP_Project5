Project 5: Part 1 / 4
 video Chapter 2 - Part 12

 Create a branch named Part1

Purpose:  This project continues developing Project3.
       you will learn how to take code from existing projects and migrate only what you need to new projects
       you will learn how to write code that doesn't leak as well as how to refactor. 

 Destructors
        
 0) move all of your implementations of all functions to OUTSIDE of the class. 
 
 1) Copy 3 of your user-defined types (the ones with constructors and for()/while() loops from Project 3) here
    Choose the classes that contained nested classes.  Include the nested classes when you copy them over.

 2) add destructors
        make the destructors do something like print out the name of the class.

 3) add 2 new UDTs that use only the types you copied above as member variables.

 4) add 2 member functions that use your member variables to each of these new UDTs

 5) Add constructors and destructors to these 2 new types that do stuff.  
        maybe print out the name of the class being destructed, or call a member function of one of the members.  be creative
 
 6) copy over your main() from the end of Project3 
        get it to compile with the types you copied over.
        remove any code in main() that uses types you didn't copy over.
 
 7) Instantiate your 2 UDT's from step 4) in the main() function at the bottom.
       call their member functions.
 
 8) After you finish, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
